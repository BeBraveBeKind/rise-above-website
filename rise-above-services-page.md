## Frequently Asked Questions

**"How long does implementation really take?"**
Marketing Intelligence Suite: 2-3 weeks. Custom agents: 2 weeks. Pilots: 2 weeks. I don't do 6-month implementations.

**"What if our team resists the change?"**
I position agents as assistants, not replacements. Your team gets to stop doing boring work and focus on strategy. Most love it.

**"Can we start small and scale up?"**
Absolutely. Most clients start with a pilot or single agent, see the value, then expand. No pressure to do everything at once.

**"What about data security?"**
Everything is SOC 2 Type II compliant. Your data never trains public models. I work within your security requirements.

**"Do you work with our industry?"**
I've worked with B2B SaaS, manufacturing, retail, and professional services. Workflows are similar across industries - content is content, leads are leads.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
If you don't see measurable improvement in 60 days, I refund the setup fee. But that's never happened.
