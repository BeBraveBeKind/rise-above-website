## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**"Do you have case studies in my industry?" I've worked across B2B SaaS, manufacturing, retail, and professional services. The beauty of AI agents is they adapt to any industry - the workflows are similar, the content changes.**

**"How do I know the ROI is real?" Every metric shown is from actual implementations. Your results will vary based on your starting point, but the efficiency gains are consistent across all deployments.**

**"What if we're not ready for full automation?" Perfect. Start with a pilot. One agent, one workflow, proven results. Then scale at your pace.**
