### **FAQ Section**
## **Straight Answers**

**"I'm not technical. Will I be able to use this?"** That's the point. These are applications with buttons and forms, not code to manage. If you can use Salesforce, you can use these.

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"** ChatGPT is a tool. These are complete applications that understand your business, integrate with your systems, and handle entire workflows without prompting.

**"What about our data security?"** Everything is SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR ready, and your data never trains public models. I can work within your security requirements.

**"What if we already have marketing automation?"** Perfect. I build on top of what you have. These agents make your existing tools exponentially more powerful.

**"Why should I trust a solo consultant with this?"** Because I'm not really solo. I leverage enterprise platforms and certified specialists for implementation. You get strategic focus plus best-in-class execution.

### **About Section**


## **Hi, I'm Michael Browne**

After two decades building marketing machines for brands you know, I saw the future: **AI agents that actually deliver on the promise of automation.**

But here's what I noticed: Everyone's talking about AI. Few are building practical solutions. Even fewer understand marketing deeply enough to build the RIGHT solutions.

That's where I come in.

I'm not selling you technology. I'm building you competitive advantage.
