### FAQ Section

**I'm not technical. Will I be able to use this?**
That's the point. These are applications with buttons and forms, not code to manage. If you can use Salesforce, you can use these.

**How is this different from ChatGPT?**
ChatGPT is a tool. These are complete applications that understand your business, integrate with your systems, and handle entire workflows without prompting.

**What about our data security?**
Everything is SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR ready, and your data never trains public models. I can work within your security requirements.

**What if we already have marketing automation?**
Perfect. I build on top of what you have. These agents make your existing tools exponentially more powerful.

**Why should I trust a solo consultant with this?**
Because I'm not really solo. I leverage enterprise platforms and certified specialists for implementation. You get strategic focus plus best-in-class execution.
