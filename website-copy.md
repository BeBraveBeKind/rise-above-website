**Subheadline:** Common questions about AI agents for marketing teams.

**Q: I'm not technical. Will I be able to use this?**

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT is a tool. These are complete applications that understand your business, integrate with your systems, and handle entire workflows without prompting.

**Q: What about our data security?**
A: Everything is SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR ready, and your data never trains public models. I can work within your security requirements.

**Q: What if we already have marketing automation?**
A: Perfect. I build on top of what you have. These agents make your existing tools exponentially more powerful.

**Q: Why should I trust a solo consultant with this?**
A: Because I'm not really solo. I leverage enterprise platforms and certified specialists for implementation. You get strategic focus plus best-in-class execution.
