A: ChatGPT is a tool. These are complete applications that understand your business, integrate with your systems, and handle entire workflows without prompting.

**Q: What about our data security?**
A: Everything is SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR ready, and your data never trains public models. I can work within your security requirements.

**Q: What if we already have marketing automation?**
A: Perfect. I build on top of what you have. These agents make your existing tools exponentially more powerful.

**Q: Why should I trust a solo consultant with this?**
